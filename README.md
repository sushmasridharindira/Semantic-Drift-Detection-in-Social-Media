**Semantic-Drift-Detection-in-Social-Media**

Language evolves continuously, reflecting shifts in society, politics, and culture. While long-term
diachronic studies of semantic change are well established, less attention has been paid to
short-term variation in fast-moving online environments. This paper addresses that gap by
examining how the words cloud, nurse, and woke vary semantically in Reddit discussions within
a one-month period (August 25–September 24, 2025). The study combines multilingual BERT
embeddings with dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to uncover meaning clusters
and track variation. Results reveal three distinct modes of semantic change: cloud exemplifies
domain divergence, with technological and meteorological senses coexisting; nurse illustrates
polysemy, where professional and figurative uses remain active in parallel; and woke reflects
ideological contestation, where supportive and pejorative uses polarize discourse. Beyond
demonstrating the methodological feasibility of applying computational semantics to short-term
online data, the findings highlight how cultural and political contexts shape semantic drift in real
time. Ethical considerations—including privacy, platform bias, and risks of
misinterpretation—are addressed to ensure responsible research practice. Overall, the study
contributes to understanding how meanings emerge, compete, and shift in dynamic online
communities, and it proposes directions for future work on multilingual and longitudinal data.
